    "description": "Diving into my academic archive, you'll stumble upon a side project birthed during my bachelor's daysâ€”an open-source venture that reflects the technical intricacies I grappled with in the realm of game development. This project, seamlessly compatible with Unreal Engine 4.26, stands as a testament to my hands-on experience in both the Blueprint system and C++ code.\n\nDelving into the intricacies, this first-person shooter project unfolds as a dynamic arena where players navigate tunnels, confronting challenges imposed by a goblin invasion. Not merely a game, but a robust system where players progress, unlocking new abilities and power-ups.",

    "description": "J-Ecdar my master's thesis project, I focused on advancing the field of model-checking tools, specifically targeting the Uppaal branch called Ecdar. Ecdar operates with models based on Timed Input/Output Automata, supporting essential features such as refinement, composition, and conjunction. \n\nMy two-semester endeavor aimed at creating Jecdar, an open-source model-checking engine, aligning with the capabilities of Ecdar 0.10. The initial phase involved extending Jecdar's existing features, but unexpected challenges arose during the verification of the refinement feature. This led to a profound investigation into state-space exploration issues and inconsistencies between Ecdar 0.10's implementation and theory.",

Committed to open-source principles, Reveaal aims to replicate the functionalities of J-Ecdar, providing a platform for efficient verification processes.\n\nThe engine leverages the ECDAR DBM Library for handling operations on temporal zones, ensuring seamless integration with existing tools. Designed to operate efficiently across multiple cores and potentially scale over diverse machines, the engine sets ambitious goals in terms of correctness and performance.",

My primary focus involved the development of a seamless integration between the Argos3 simulation and Uppaal, a crucial aspect of the project. \n\nOur collective goal was to design an efficient mechanism for a swarm of robots to collaboratively execute a set of tasks without causing interference. Leveraging Uppaal's capabilities, we aimed to create an optimal system where robots could operate harmoniously, avoiding conflicts while performing intricate tasks. This innovative approach holds promising applications, such as optimizing processes in manufacturing environments like a Lego factory, where robots could work collaboratively to assemble custom orders of Lego bricks without disruption.
