    "description": "J-Ecdar my master's thesis project, I focused on advancing the field of model-checking tools, specifically targeting the Uppaal branch called Ecdar. Ecdar operates with models based on Timed Input/Output Automata, supporting essential features such as refinement, composition, and conjunction. \n\nMy two-semester endeavor aimed at creating Jecdar, an open-source model-checking engine, aligning with the capabilities of Ecdar 0.10. The initial phase involved extending Jecdar's existing features, but unexpected challenges arose during the verification of the refinement feature. This led to a profound investigation into state-space exploration issues and inconsistencies between Ecdar 0.10's implementation and theory.",

The monotony and tedium of repetitive actions prompted me to seek a solution through automation. \"Attachable-clicker\" is a product of one such instance when I was gaming with friends and faced the need to repeatedly execute the same action. \n\nConventional clickers fell short, as they typically restrict other PC activities once activated. This led me to develop an attachable-clicker that sends commands directly to the selected window, allowing users to continue using their computer while the clicker remains active.\n\nThe project is coded in C++ and leverages the Qt framework for its graphical user interface (GUI).",
